# Development and Standards Specification

## 1. Development Methodology

### 1.1 Chosen Methodology
- Kanban-style agile workflow tailored for solo development.
- Visual task tracking using lightweight tools such as GitHub Projects or even simple to-do lists.
- Flexible, continuous work cycles without strict sprint deadlines.
- Prioritize iterative development with frequent small releases.

### 1.2 Team Structure
- Single developer responsible for all aspects of development.
- Self-management of tasks, priorities, and timelines.

## 2. Coding Standards

### 2.1 General Coding Principles
- Maintain code readability and simplicity.
- Use modular, reusable components and functions.
- Follow DRY and KISS principles.
- Consistent naming conventions and formatting.

### 2.2 Language-Specific Standards

#### 2.2.1 Frontend Standards
- TypeScript with React (functional components and hooks).
- Styling with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI.
- Accessibility using semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.

#### 2.2.2 Backend Standards
- Use Next.js API routes to implement backend logic.
- Prefer GraphQL endpoints for client-server communication.
- REST APIs only if necessary for specific integrations.
- Write clean, modular, well-documented backend code.

### 2.3 Code Review Process
- Self-review before committing code.
- Use automated linting (ESLint) and formatting (Prettier).
- Utilize GitHub’s pull request system for any external contributions or future collaborators.

## 3. Version Control

### 3.1 Repository Management
- Git for version control.
- Branching strategy:
  - `main` for stable production code.
  - `develop` for ongoing development.
  - Feature branches for new work.

### 3.2 Commit Standards
- Use Conventional Commits standard via `commitizen` or similar tooling.
- Format:  
  `type(scope): short description`  
  Example: `feat(meal-planning): add weekly plan generation`

## 4. Testing Strategy

### 4.1 Testing Types
- Unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library.
- Integration tests for API routes.
- End-to-end tests deferred until post-MVP.

### 4.2 Test Coverage
- Aim for >80% coverage on critical code.
- Use coverage reports to monitor.

### 4.3 Continuous Integration
- GitHub Actions for automated testing on pull requests and merges.
- Deploy to Vercel automatically on `main` merges.

## 5. Quality Assurance

### 5.1 Code Quality
- Enforce linting with ESLint and Prettier.
- Monitor code complexity using simple metrics or optional tools.

### 5.2 Performance Monitoring
- Use Vercel Analytics or browser devtools for frontend performance.
- Simple backend logging for API performance.

## 6. Technical Debt Management

### 6.1 Identification
- Track technical debt informally in issue tracker or project board.
- Prioritize based on impact and time available.

### 6.2 Mitigation Strategies
- Regularly allocate time to refactor and clean code.
- Use code reviews even if self-conducted to maintain quality.

## 7. Implementation Roadmap

### 7.1 Project Phases
- Setup and architecture design.
- Core feature development (recipes, meal planning).
- AI features integration (post-MVP).
- Testing, deployment, and monitoring.

### 7.2 Milestones
- MVP release.
- Offline mode implementation.
- AI-powered recipe suggestions.

### 7.3 Resource Allocation
- Sole developer with learning goals on Next.js, GraphQL, Supabase, and AI integration.

## 8. Documentation Standards

### 8.1 Code Documentation
- Inline comments where logic is non-obvious.
- Use JSDoc/TSDoc for function/method documentation.
- Maintain ADRs for architectural decisions.

### 8.2 External Documentation
- Comprehensive README.md with setup and usage instructions.
- API documentation via GraphQL Playground or similar.

## 9. Security Standards

### 9.1 Secure Coding Practices
- Input validation and sanitization.
- Avoid sensitive data in client code.
- Regularly update dependencies.

### 9.2 Data Protection
- Enforce HTTPS.
- Use Supabase’s authentication and security features.
- Role-based access control.

## 10. Compliance and Governance

### 10.1 Regulatory Compliance
- GDPR-aware handling of user data.
- Maintain compliance checklists.

### 10.2 Ethical Considerations
- Inclusive and accessible design.
- Respect user privacy and data rights.
